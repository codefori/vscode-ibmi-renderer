**This repository is out of sync with the VS Code extension found in the Marketplace and in OpenVSX**. As we transition to a new DDS renderer, the old renderer is deprecated and replace with this new real-time DDS editor.

## IBM i Renderer

⚠️ Still in development. Not ready for production.

Adds a new editor to VS Code for IBM i display files.

[See the project board](https://github.com/orgs/codefori/projects/7) for remaining functionality.
